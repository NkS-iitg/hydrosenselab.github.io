Joined as an Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Before this I used to work in NASA Goddard and NCAR. I received my PhD in Water Resources Engineering from the University of Oklahoma. Since 2020, I have started setting up the HydroSense Lab in IITD, dedicated primarily to disaster modeling and mitigation. Currently, we are interested in developing techniques and systems for forecasting natural hazards such as floods, droughts, and landslides. I am currently recruiting at all levels for our research group - Postdocs, PhD, Masters, UG interns.
