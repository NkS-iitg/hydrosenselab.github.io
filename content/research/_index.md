# Research

The overarching goal of our research is to develop solutions that reduce the impact of natural disasters. Our research seeks to disentangle the complex relationships between geomorphology, climate, precipitation, and runoff generation using physics-based and data-driven models. Our interests include, but are not limited to:

	- Land surface/hydrologic modeling
	- Statistics and machine Learning
	- Hydrologic extremes, Flood and drought forecasting
	- Radar and satellite precipitation
	- Remote sensing applications in hydrology
	- Crowdsourcing
