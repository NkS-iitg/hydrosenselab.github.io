## WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## We seek to simulate and investigate the terrestrial hydrological cycle using physics-based and data-driven models. Currently, we are interested in developing techniques and systems for monitoring and forecasting water-related natural hazards, with a special focus on the worst-affected regions of the world. The overarching goal of our research is to develop solutions that reduce the impact of natural disasters.
